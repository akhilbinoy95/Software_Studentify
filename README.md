# SoSe-2024-Group-C
## Studentify 
The application is designed to assist prospective, newly admitted, and already admitted students who want to socialize, make friends, and join interesting activities within the university area.

This software will be installed on a single computer where students can come to browse, add, or join events. Every month, all student organizations will update their information accordingly, ensuring that students have access to the latest happenings on campus.

## Important points to be noted : 
* In commit the commits from **DESKTOP-23RLU4I\user** is Joel Varughese Thomas. there are some issues while pushing that we couldnt rectify.
* Our third member Mr. Chandu Hara Gopal, has actively participated in the initial phase like system Architecture and requirement engineering. However he couldnt join for other activities, so we couldnt implement all the requirment and functionality in coding, hence we have to reduce it.
* The entire coding is done through pair programming, hence both the students, Mr. Akhil and Mr. Joel has equal participation in every module. 
* A detailed video on working of software and a report has been uploaded with more details regarding the software.
